    <h2>Information about your right of objection according to Art. 21 GDPR
    </h2>
    <h3>Individual right of objection</h3>
    <p>You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing
        of
        personal data relating to you, which is based on Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (data processing on the basis of a
        balance
        of interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 4 GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>If you file an objection, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling
        legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to
        assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
